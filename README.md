# Challenge - Even Numbers
## RULES: 
1. NO FOREACH
2. NO DO/WHILE
3. NO DO
4. NO WHILE
5. Must be able to handle exceptions
6. Must be able to pass all tests.
7. List must return in order from least to greatest.


## Task - 
Write a method named evenNums() with the parameter \<Integer :: max >. The Method must Return a collection of integers containing all even numbers from 0 to \<Integer :: max >.

#### Workflow:
1. Ask the user for their Input.
2. Throw the Input into the function as an argument.
3. Iterate all numbers (from 0 to max).
4. Check if each number is even.
5. Push all even numbers into a Collection and return said Collection.

### Extra:
1. Create a function with no return called eachEven. Have it display each Index of the 
    collection using only a For Loop. Print out each result to the Terminal.

#### Extra Workflow:
6. Write a new function

7. Iterate Across the Collection and print each value.
